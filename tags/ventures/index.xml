      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back I was lucky enough to attend and present at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/global-artificial-intelligence-conference/schedule-83.html&#34;&gt;Global AI Summit&lt;/a&gt; in the bay area. This is my personal trip report about the people I have met and some of the projects and startups I came across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI is eating the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First of all, let me start by saying that literally &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; is doing (or claiming to do) AI in the bay area. AI has inflamed the spirits of pretty much every single software engineer, data scientist, business developer, talent scout, and VC in the greater San Francisco area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All tools and services presented at the conference embed some form of machine intelligence, and scientists are the new cool kids on the block. Software engineering has probably reached an all-time low in terms of coolness in the bay area, and regarded almost as the &amp;ldquo;necessary evil&amp;rdquo; in order to unleash the next AI interface. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, as actually &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/03/dont-buy-machine-learning.html&#34;&gt;Machine Learning and AI are more like the raisins in raisin bread&lt;/a&gt;, as Peter Norvig and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/marcossponton&#34;&gt;Marcos Sponton&lt;/a&gt; say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&#39;s behind AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Good engineering, and great business focus is still the foundation of many AI-powered tools and services. In my opinion, there is no silver bullet: AI powered applications must still be based on good engineering practices if they want to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen a similar wave during the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble&#34;&gt;dot-com&lt;/a&gt; bubble in the beginning of the millennium when web-shops were popping up with little understanding of the underlying retail and marketplace businesses. Since then, web applications have matured and today we value those services both for their digital journey as much as for their operational excellence and their ability to deliver. I believe that a similar maturing path will happen for AI powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is still a very opaque concept. In the worst case it could be just a scripted process, more often is a set of predictive machine learning models. Because of the vagueness of the term, others are branding new terms in order to differentiate themselves: machine intelligence, cognitive/sentient computing, intelligent computing. Advertising more AI-related terms is not really helping clarifying what is running under the hood. After some digging, startups operating in the AI space are mainly interpreting AI as some form of artificial/machine learning (aka &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI&#34;&gt;weak AI&lt;/a&gt;) tailored to very specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, with some exceptions, the term AI is used to describe &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network&#34;&gt;Artificial Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt; (ANNs), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning&#34;&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; (DL) mostly related to text, speech, image, and video processing. Putting the hype aside for a moment, without any doubts we can acknowledge that &lt;a href=&#34;http://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/l2go/-/get/v/16622&#34;&gt;the renaissance of deep learning&lt;/a&gt; has contributed to the development of conversational interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of this new generation services might by still hard-coded or scripted, but the interface is going to be more and more flexible, understanding our spoken, text, and visual cues. This human-centric approach to UIs is definitely going to shape the way we interact with devices. This trend goes under the buzz of &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.careerfoundry.com/ui-design/what-is-zero-ui&#34;&gt;Natural/Zero UIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s go deeper in the stack, away from the front-end and human-machine Natural UIs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI&#34;&gt;Narrow AI&lt;/a&gt;, in particular deep learning and hierarchical predictive models are getting traction as core data components, in particular for applications such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf&#34;&gt;recommender systems&lt;/a&gt;, fraud detection, churn and propensity models, anomaly detection and data auditing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving on the following list: I am not associated with any of these companies, however I did find their approach worth mentioning and good food for thoughts for the entrepreneurs and the data people following this blog. So, as always, take the following with a pinch of salt and apply your critical &amp;amp; analytical thinking to it. Enjoy :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://numenta.com/applications/&#34;&gt;Numenta&lt;/a&gt; is tackling one of the most important scientific challenges of all time: reverse engineering the neocortex. Studying how the brain works helps us understand the principles of intelligence and build machines that work on the same principles. They have invested heavily in time series research, anomaly detection and natural language processing. By converting text, and geo-spatial data to time series Numenta can detect patterns and anomalies in temporal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.recognos.com/smart-data-platform/&#34;&gt;Recognos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; main product &amp;ldquo;Smart Data Platform&amp;rdquo; is meant to normalize and integrate the data that is stored in unstructured, semi-structured and structured content. The data unification process is driven by the business ontology. Data extraction, taxonomy, semantic tagging and structured data mapping are all steps in this modern approach to data preparation and normalization. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.recognos.com/smart-data-platform/&#34;&gt;Recognos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; ultimate goal is to allow to use the data that is stored in the un-structured, semi-structured and structured content using a unique semantic meaning and unique query language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appzen.com/&#34;&gt;Appzen&lt;/a&gt; is picking up the challenge of automating the auditing of expenses in real-time. This service collects all receipts, tickets, and other documentation provided and produces a full understanding of the who, where, and why of every expense. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appzen.com/&#34;&gt;Appzen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s machine learning engine verifies receipts, eliminates duplicates, and searches through hundreds of data sources to verify merchant identities and validate the truthfulness of every expense – ensuring there is no fraud, misuse, or violation of laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://talla.com/features&#34;&gt;Talla&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight system which plugs into messaging systems as a virtual team members, executing on-boarding, e-learning, and team building process flows, and engaging with the various team members, taking over from tasks which are usually done by team managers, scrum masters, and facilitating teams. It employs a combination of natural language processing, robotic process automation, and user- and company- defined rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inbenta.com/en/features/self-service/&#34;&gt;Inbenta&lt;/a&gt; has build an extensive multilingual knowledge supporting over 25 native languages and counting, including English, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and German. Its NLP engine understands the nuances of human conversation, so it answers a query based on meaning, not individual keywords. This is a good example of a company which relies on good business development and a great core team of linguistics and language experts. By combining these elements with NLP and Deep Learning techniques they can power &lt;a href=&#34;http://medium.com/cyber-tales/ai-and-speech-recognition-a-primer-for-chatbots-a63af042526a#.o8svmik8j&#34;&gt;chatbots&lt;/a&gt;, email management, surveys and other text-based use cases for a number of verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lymba.com/knowledge-extraction-k-extractor.html&#34;&gt;Lymba&lt;/a&gt; is also tackling textual information, with the goal of extracting insights and non-trivial bits of knowledge from a semantic graph of heterogeneous linked data elements. Lymba offers transformative capabilities that enable discovery of actionable knowledge from structured and unstructured data, providing business with invaluable insights. Lymba has developed a technology for deep semantic processing that extracts semantic relations between all concepts in the text. One of Lymba&#39;s product, the &amp;ldquo;K-extractor&amp;rdquo; enables intelligent search, question answering, summarization of a document, generating scientific profiles, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetlore.com/dynamic-layouts/&#34;&gt;Jetlore&lt;/a&gt; is bringing personalization one step further by creating websites and mobile apps which are extremely tailored to each user, both in terms of content as well as layout, color, highlights, promotions, images, and offers. All site assets are ranked individually for each customer, and selected at the time of interaction based on the layout&#39;s configuration. Jetlore can select the best categories, brands, and collections of products from your inventory for each user, and automatically feature the best images to represent them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ownerlistens.com/&#34;&gt;Ownerlisten&lt;/a&gt; is a smart messaging pipelining solution, rerouting messages in a given organization to the right person or process depending on the nature of the message. Users can filter and process messages combining business rules as well as automated text processing. This is essential in businesses where machine learned models might not be provide sufficiently accuracy for certain topics. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ownerlistens.com/&#34;&gt;Ownerlisten&lt;/a&gt; is another good example of how AI and NLP can be organically combined with user defined messaging and communication flows. By combining domain expertise, solid engineering and NLP engines, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ownerlistens.com/&#34;&gt;ownerlisten&lt;/a&gt; can deliver very smooth user and customer journeys in a number of different industries and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list would not be complete without at least a company offering AI, Machine Learning, Data plumbing, Data engineering, API and Application engineering services. Software and data engineering, might be less cool a land of scientists, but it&#39;s still the backbone on top of which all those awesome solutions and products are built. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.datamonsters.co/&#34;&gt;Data Monster&lt;/a&gt; is one of those great studios accelerating mvp and product development, with a strong affinity to data processing at scale and all the right techs in the basket (Scala, Python, R, Java, JavaScript, Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Play, Akka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS, Cassandra, etc ).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rewind 2016</title>
      <link>/post/rewind-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/rewind-2016/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2016 has been simply incredible. What you will read next is a summary of my journey last year. It&#39;s mostly an open letter to thank all the wonderful people that inspired and supported me in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job wise, the year started at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ing.com/&#34;&gt;ING&lt;/a&gt; as enterprise data architect where I followed closely several scrum teams on cutting edge projects such as streaming analytics, fraud and cyber security, api&#39;s, data lakes, and predictive analytics. I really would like to thank ING, in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://nl.linkedin.com/in/henkkolk&#34;&gt;Henk Kolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhmjacobs&#34;&gt;Peter Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nl.linkedin.com/in/beatezwijnenberg&#34;&gt;Beate Zwijnenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpmjacobs&#34;&gt;Paul Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://nl.linkedin.com/in/ferdscheepers&#34;&gt;Ferd Scheepers&lt;/a&gt; and so many others which I have met during my last engagements at ING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey has continued in 2016 with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.teradata.com/&#34;&gt;Teradata&lt;/a&gt;, where I am currently involved in the middle of a huge transformation from products to services, where Teradata is expanding from an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse&#34;&gt;EDW&lt;/a&gt; vendor to a data-driven solution selling enterprise, where open source, data science, and tailored data architecture are becoming the new &amp;ldquo;bread and butter&amp;rdquo; for new business creation. A &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; is due to the Teradata team in particular to &lt;a href=&#34;https://nl.linkedin.com/in/sergiofranssen&#34;&gt;Sergio Franssen&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Professional Services in Benelux and Eric-Jan van Meningen, Global Sales Director and to a great team of awesome data scientists and data engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I have enjoyed participating to a number of initiatives: writing blogs and tutorials for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/&#34;&gt;O&#39;Reilly Media Group&lt;/a&gt; where I would like to thank Ben Lorica, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceteri&#34;&gt;Paco Nathan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannon-cutt-79303054&#34;&gt;Shannon Cutt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://radar.oreilly.com/jennw&#34;&gt;Jenn Webb&lt;/a&gt; and so many others for the warm support during the last projects together. Deepening into AI with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cognitivefinance.ai/&#34;&gt;Cognitive Finance Group&lt;/a&gt; founded by &lt;a href=&#34;https://uk.linkedin.com/in/claradurodie&#34;&gt;Clara Durondie&lt;/a&gt;. Also supporting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thepalladiumgroup.com/&#34;&gt;Palladium&lt;/a&gt; team, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ae.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-aref-a14a906&#34;&gt;Mohamed El Aref&lt;/a&gt;. Last but not least, I have always enjoyed the meetups of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spark.tc/&#34;&gt;IBM Spark Technology Council&lt;/a&gt;, and I would like to thank in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertdthomas&#34;&gt;Robert Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharinekearnan&#34;&gt;Katharine Kearnan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/remus-lazar-9766984&#34;&gt;Remus Lazar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/holdenkarau&#34;&gt;Holden Karau&lt;/a&gt; for the great discussion about Spark devs at the IBM spark technology center and pokemons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech evangelism would not be worth this name without a thriving community of crazy coders, mad scientists, and puny hackers, and the many online and life meetup sessions and code sharing events, webinars and hot discussions on the future of Data Computing and Data Science, thank you all for sharing code and ideas! I have learned so much from you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some buddies of mine out there are building some amazing techs so I wish the very best to &lt;a href=&#34;https://uk.linkedin.com/in/edwardkibardin&#34;&gt;Edward Kibardin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://datarefiner.com/&#34;&gt;datarefiner.com&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/cfregly&#34;&gt;Chris Fregly&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://pipeline.io/&#34;&gt;pipeline.io&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;https://nl.linkedin.com/in/olafmolenveld&#34;&gt;Olaf Molenveld&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://vamp.io/&#34;&gt;vamp.io&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;https://it.linkedin.com/in/gaspare-maria-55b4996&#34;&gt;Gaspare Maria&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gfmintegration.com/&#34;&gt;continua&lt;/a&gt;) for keeping up the great work of building AI and Data-Driven solutions on top of bespoken open-source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiration is a two way street, as the energy and the effort you put into studying, learning and developing ideas comes back as feedback and support from those who follow you. So a big thank you, to you who are reading this right now. It&#39;s you that push me to do event better the next time and keep it up the great work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology: What have I learned this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 has seen me getting even more involved with &lt;a href=&#34;http://spark.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt;, both on the Scala and the Python APIs. Next to that, loads of deep learning on my daily diet, in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://keras.io/&#34;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/&#34;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt;, both on bespoken data sets (CIFAR, MNIST) but also &amp;ldquo;on the job&amp;rdquo; on financial, telecom and social data. Another fantastic discovery this year was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jupyter.org/&#34;&gt;Jupyter project&lt;/a&gt; as it goes way way further than the bespoken notebook. In particular, I have spent some time on jupyter-powered APIs with the jupiter gateway project. Also notable mention to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://toree.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache Toree&lt;/a&gt; project which provides a Spark/Scala kernel to Jupyter, as I consider it probably the best notebook integration available, next to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook&#34;&gt;Spark Notebook&lt;/a&gt; of my buddies &lt;a href=&#34;https://be.linkedin.com/in/andypetrella&#34;&gt;Andy Petrella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://be.linkedin.com/in/xavier-tordoir-ba95b673&#34;&gt;Xavier Tordoir&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kensu.io/&#34;&gt;kensu.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology wise, this year was the definitely the year of Spark, Flink, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Akka and Kafka. A lot of great architectures and stacks have be crafted using these building blocks for a variety of use cases and scenarios, such as Finance, Telecom, and HealthTech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud technologies have also been a revelation for me in 2016, with advances and innovations such as containers-as-a-service, cloud AI/ML services, better virtualization technologies with GPU support and better resource negotiators. Worth mentioning three techs I have enjoyed this year are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mesos.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Mesos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept the course on the following, going deeper understanding the techs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://spark.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cassandra.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elastic.co/&#34;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kafka.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://akka.io/&#34;&gt;Akka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scikit-learn.org/&#34;&gt;Scikit-Learn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pandas.pydata.org/&#34;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New learning items this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://keras.io/&#34;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/&#34;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jupyter.org/&#34;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://toree.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Toree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Speaking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an incredible year for speaking, and i was honoured to present at some really great events on some of my lifetime passions/topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed Computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI and ML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictive APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks, Meetups, Presentations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total I delivered the following during this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 webinars at Bright Talks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brighttalk.com/search?duration=0..&amp;amp;q=busa&amp;amp;rank=entrytime&#34;&gt;https://www.brighttalk.com/search?duration=0..&amp;amp;q=busa&amp;amp;rank=entrytime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
